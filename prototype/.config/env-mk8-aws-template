# AWS Credentials for mk8-prototype
# This is a TEMPLATE file with DUMMY values
#
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT edit this file with real credentials!
# Instead, copy this template to your home directory and edit that copy:
#
#   cp .config/env-mk8-aws-template ~/.config/env-mk8-aws
#   chmod 600 ~/.config/env-mk8-aws
#   # Edit ~/.config/env-mk8-aws with your real AWS credentials
#
# The env-bootstrap.sh utility will:
#   1. First check for ~/.config/env-mk8-aws (real credentials)
#   2. Fall back to this template (dummy credentials) if not found
#
# This allows you to:
#   - Keep real credentials in your home directory (gitignored)
#   - Keep dummy template in the repo for reference
#   - Source env-bootstrap.sh to automatically load the right credentials

# AWS Access Key ID (20 characters, starts with AKIA)
export MK8_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"

# AWS Secret Access Key (40 characters, base64-encoded)
export MK8_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"

# AWS Region (default: us-east-1)
export MK8_AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# Note: These are DUMMY credentials from AWS documentation examples
# They will NOT work for actual AWS API calls
# Get your real credentials from AWS IAM Console:
# https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials
