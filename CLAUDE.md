# ⚠️ DO NOT ADD CONTENT TO THIS FILE

**ALL content belongs in AGENTS.md, not here.**

This file exists only to redirect you to the correct location.

## Read AGENTS.md First

**[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** contains ALL base context:
- Complete spec workflow (Requirements → Design → Tasks)
- Task execution process
- Development requirements
- Testing requirements
- Code quality standards
- Command reference
- Everything you need

---

## Why This File Exists

Historical reasons. It should remain minimal and redirect to AGENTS.md.

**If you think something should be added here, add it to AGENTS.md instead.**
